# 🔮 Pointer.gg Faucet bot

Looking for testnet tokens 👀 ? No worries pointer.gg faucet bot has got you covered.

## 🤔 How does it work ?

Get started by joining pointer.gg's discord server - https://discord.gg/pointer.

Run the `-faucet` command with the first argument the wallet address and the second argument as the network on which you want to get the testnet tokens. For example:

`-faucet 0xd24CA0297558f0827e2C467603869D1AC9fF435d polygon`

This would send 1 MATIC to `0xd24CA0297558f0827e2C467603869D1AC9fF435d` address on MATIC Mumbai network.

Currently we only support two networks:

- `polygon` - MATIC Mumbai
- `rinkeby` - Rinkeby

## 😿 I am unable to get testnet tokens

The reason might be that you might have crossed the faucet request limit. Use `-limit` to check your faucet requests.

The reason we have added a faucet request limit is because of the shortage of funds.

If you need more testnet tokens, feel free to contact us on discord - Kira.#3246 and Avneesh#4961

## ✨ Funding the faucet

If you are willing to fund us, you can send the testnet tokens over to this wallet address: 0x9321Cec47b5d686Ff230e6c3bEa987F81737e42e. Thanks in advance for your support.

## 💰 How much do I get on each request ?

Currently we are giving away 1 MATIC and 0.1 ETH for each request on their respective networks.
